### **Plot**: Help Billy Madison stop Eric from taking over Madison Hotels!
### Sneaky Eric Gordon has installed malware on Billy's computer right before the two of them are set to face off in an academic decathlon. Unless Billy can regain control of his machine and decrypt his 12th grade final project, he will not graduate from high school. Plus, it means Eric wins, and he takes over as head of Madison Hotels!
### **Objective**: The primary objective of the VM is to figure out how Eric took over the machine and then undo his changes so you can recover Billy's 12th grade final project. You will *probably* need to root the box to complete this objective.
