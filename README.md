## 🚀 Why This Exists

I'm Dev Thakur ([@cyb3rsec-me](https://github.com/cyb3rsec-me)), a red teamer and cybersecurity learner with a passion for offensive security.

> My PC was filling up with dozens of labs, writeups, screenshots, and tools I used to learn and grow.  
> Rather than risk losing it all, I’m dumping my progress here — raw, real, and evolving.

This repo is:
- My **archive**
- My **portfolio**
